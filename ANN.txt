what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets. (Not a renderer  though!)

main changes
------------
0.9.5b2
    + **BUGFIX**: Reading referenced styleSheet in CSSImportRule did not succeed as no encoding information if passed along. Encoding of references sheet default to 'css' now.

    + BUGFIX: Setting ``atkeyword`` of @rules checks if it is a valid keyword for the specific rule. E.g. an @import rule accepts ``@im\port`` but not ``@namespace``.
    + BUGFIX: Fixed setting ``name`` of CSSImportRule. Setting ``name`` other than with a string results in xml.dom.SyntaxErr raised now
    + BUGFIX: ``CSSStyleSheet.type`` with a fixed value of "text/css" and other readonly properties are really readonly now

    - IMPROVEMENT: Added ``__repr__`` for ``cssutils.util._SimpleNamespaces`` which is used in a selector repr.


Note:
    CSSValue, CSSValueList, and CSSPrimitiveValue and the relevant methods/properties Property.cssValue and CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyCSSValue are more or less DEPRECATED and will probably be replaced with interfaces defined in CSSOM. For now use the properties and methods that handle values as simple strings, e.g. ``Property.value``. As the aforementioned classes are not hardly that useful anyway this should not be a big problem but please beware if you use or have used them.

    If you think this a bad idea please let me know!

The included `encutils <http://cthedot.de/encutils/>`__ has been updated to version 0.8.2 with a compatible LGPL license. `restserver.py <http://cthedot.de/restserver/>`__ has been updates to version 2.1 which is in the public domain now (no Creative Commons license anymore). So only a single license (the LGPL) is used throughout cssutils now. If you have other licensing needs please let me know.
