what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets. (Not a renderer though!)

about this release
------------------
0.9.7b1 is a beta release but quite stable now I guess...

main changes
------------
0.9.7b1 optimizes handling speed of CSSVariables *a lot*...

changes
    + **API CHANGE**: Child objects like the ``cssRules`` of a ``CSSStyleSheet`` or ``CSSMediaRule`` are no longer kept after resetting the complete contents of an object (setting ``cssText``). This should not be expected anyway but if you relied on something like the following please beware::

            sheet = cssutils.parseString('a { color: red}')
            initial_rules = sheet.cssRules
            sheet.cssText = 'b { color: green}'
            # true until 0.9.6a6: assert sheet.cssRules == initial_rules, but now:
            assert sheet.cssRules != initial_rules

    + **IMPROVEMENT**: Massive speed improvement of handling of CSSVariables of a stylesheet which due to naive implementation was unbelievable slow when using a lot of vars... Should now scale a lot better, about factor 5-20 depending of amount of variables used.
    + IMPROVEMENT: Fair amount of refactoring resulting in a bit speed improvement generally too
    + CHANGE: If a CSS variable should be resolved (``cssutils.ser.prefs.resolveVariables == true``) but no value can be found a WARNING is logged now. Should be an ERROR actually but as currently lots of "fake" errors are reported would probably hurt more than help. A future release might improve this.
    + BUGFIX: Syntax of value of CSS Fonts Module Level 3 ``src`` property now validates if local font name is given with a quoted name, e.g.: ``src: local('Yanone Kaffeesatz')``
