what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets. (Not a renderer though!)

about this release
------------------
0.9.7b2 is a beta release but quite stable...

main changes
------------
0.9.7b2 100606
    + IMPROVEMENT/BUGFIX: CSSFunction value parameters may contain HASH values like ``#fff`` now. These are used in experimental properties like ``-moz-linear-gradient(top,#fff,#fff 55%,#e4e4e4)``. Fixes issue #38.

    + API CHANGE: ``cssutils.ser.prefs.resolveVariables == True`` is the default from 0.9.7b2 as CSSVariables are not in any official specification yet and better reflects what you probably want after serializing a stylesheet...
