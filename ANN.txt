what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets.

main changes since 0.9.4a1
--------------------------
for full details see the relevant README file http://cssutils.googlecode.com/svn/tags/TAG_0.9.4a2/README.txt

 - **FEATURE**: added ``Preferences.useMinified()`` which sets preferences that a stylesheet will be serialized as compact as possible. Added ``Preferences.useDefaults()`` which resets the serializer preferences. There a few new preferences have been added as well (see the documentation for details as most are hardly useful for normal usage of the library)

    + **BUGFIX**: Fixed parsing of ``font`` value which uses "font-size/line-height" syntax.

    - CHANGE: ``Preferences.keepAllProperties`` defaults to ``True`` now (hardly used but safer if different values have been set which are used by different UAs for example.)
