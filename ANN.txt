about this release
------------------
0.9.6a1 is an alpha release.

main changes
------------
0.9.6a1 090207
    - **API CHANGE**: Known but invalid properties raise/log an ERROR instead of a WARNING now. Properties not expected in the current profile log an INFO. As the default profile is ``None`` even basic properties like ``color`` are logged now. You may want to change the default profile by setting e.g. ``cssutils.profiles.defaultprofile = cssutils.profiles.Profiles.CSS_LEVEL_2`` (~ CSS 2.1) to prevent CSS 2.1 properties to be reported. Also other validation related output has been slightly changed.

        **The way to change a defaultprofile may change again.**

    - **API CHANGE**: ``cssutils.script.csscombine`` has **ONLY** keyword parameters now. Use ``csscombine(path=path[,...])`` for the old behaviour. New parameter ``url`` combines the sheet at URL now.

    + **FEATURE**: Added **experimental** profiles handling. You may add new profiles with new properties and their validation and set a defaultprofile used for validation. The current default profile is ``None`` so all predefined profiles are used. Currently 3 profiles are defined:

      :attr:`~cssutils.profiles.Profiles.Profiles.CSS_LEVEL_2`
            Properties defined by CSS2.1
      :attr:`~cssutils.profiles.Profiles.Profiles.CSS_COLOR_LEVEL_3`
            CSS 3 color properties
      :attr:`~cssutils.profiles.Profiles.Profiles.CSS_BOX_LEVEL_3`
            Currently overflow related properties only

      See the docs and source of the cssutils.profiles module for details.

    + **FEATURE**:  ``cssutils.util._readUrl()`` allows fetchers to pre-decode CSS content and return `unicode` instances, with or without a specified source encoding (integrated from patch of Issue #19).

    + **FEATURE**: URL fetch method checks if cssutils is run in GoogleAppEngine (GAE) (if ``import google.appengine`` is successful) and uses the GAE fetch methods instead of urllib2 in that case. So in result cssutils should run on GAE just as elsewhere.
    + **FEATURE**: Function ``cssutils.resolveImports(sheet)`` returns a new stylesheet with all rules in given sheet but with all @import rules being pulled into the top sheet.
    + FEATURE: CSSCombine script and helper function resolve nested imports now.
    + FEATURE: Script ``csscombine`` has new option ``-u URL, --url=URL     URL to parse (path is ignored if URL given)`` now

    + DOCUMENTATION: Changed documentation generation from Epydoc and home grown HTML generation to Sphinx. Not all is perfectly markup'd yet but not too bad either...
