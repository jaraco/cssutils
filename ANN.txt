about this release
------------------
0.9.7a2 is a beta release.

main changes
------------
0.9.7a2 091230
    - **API CHANGE**: Setting a style declarations' property to ``None`` or the
      empty string effectively removes this property from the declaration. 
      See also Issue #32.

    + **BUGFIX/FEATURE**: Fixed Issue 33: URL references (like ``url()``
      values) in combined sheets are now adjusted even if sheets are not in the
      same folder. Only relative paths are adjusted.

    - **BUGFIX**: Fixed parsing of FUNCTIONS in CSSUnknownRule like 
      ``@bottom { counter(page) }`` which raised a false error of a mismatch of
      parenthesis
