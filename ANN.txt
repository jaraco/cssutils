what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets. (Not a renderer though!)

about this release
------------------
0.9.6a4 is an bugfix release.


main changes
------------
    - **API CHANGE**: Reverted handling of exceptions (issue #24) as this did not work with PyXML installed. You may again use ``str(e)`` on any raised xml.dom.Exception ``e``. Since 0.9.6a0 exceptions raised did raise a tuple of message, line and col information. Now the message alone is raised (again). Line and col information is still available as ``e.line, e.col``.

    + BUGFIX: Fixed issues #22 and #23

    + BUGFIX: All examples at http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-CSS2-20090423/syndata.html#illegalvalues should work now as expected

    - **FEATURE**: Updated some parts to http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-CSS2-20090423/changes.html#new (most changes decribed there were already done in cssutils)

    - **FEATURE**: New preference option ``keepUnkownAtRules = False`` which defines if unknown atrules like e.g. ``@three-dee {...}`` are kept or not. Setting this pref to ``False`` in result removes unknown @rules from the serialized sheet which is the default for the minified settings.
