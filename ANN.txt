0.9.4b1
    - **FEATURE**: Added ``csscombine`` script which currently resolves @import rules into the input sheet. No nested @imports are resolved yet and @namespace rules do not work yet though!

    + **BUGFIX**: Serializing escape sequences add a single SPACE after each escape. This was not present until now so a sequence like "\\74 a" did come out as "\\000074a" which was not as intended. Also as a SPACE is inserted in any case all escapes are not padded to 6 digits anymore but are only as long as needed.

    + **BUGFIX**: Handling of illegal selectors is now same as the W3C CSS validator (and according the selector spec - I hope ;). Illegal selectors result the complete rule being dropped. Fixed are the following (edge) cases:

      ``a/**/b``
        Meant was probably a space between a and b (plus maybe the comment) but it MUST be inserted. IE and Safari nevertheless seem to parse this rule as ``a b`` so as if a space would be present. cssutils now parses this selector as intented by the spec as ``ab``.
      ``a*b``
        Again spaces around the UNIVERSAL ``*`` were probably meant by the author. IE and Safari seem to parse this **invalid** selector as ``a b``. cssutils ignores this rule completely!

    + BUGFIX: ``css.CSSRuleList`` is still a Python list but setting methods like ``__init__``, ``append``,     ``extend`` or ``__setslice__`` are added later on instances of this class if so desired. E.g. CSSStyleSheet adds ``append`` which is not available in a simple instance of this class! This has been changed as no validation is possible in CSSRuleList itself.

    + IMPROVEMENT: Added better ``str`` and ``repr`` to cssutils.serializer.Preferences

    + IMPROVEMENT: Added position information to some error reportings (Property, CSSMediaRule

    + some internal changes
