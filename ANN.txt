about this release
------------------
0.9.5.1 is a bugfix release.

main changes
------------
0.9.5.1 080811
    + **BUGFIX**: Fixed parsing of ``}a,b`` which resulted in TypeError until now.

    + **BUGFIX**: A rule with a selector using an undefined and therefor invalid namespace prefix is ignored now.

    + **BUGFIX**: Removed typo in MediaList which resulted in Exception when parsing medialist containing ``all`` and another media.

    + **BUGFIX**: Reading imported styles may have failed under certain conditions with an AttributeError.

    + FEATURE: Added ``cssutils.VERSION`` which is the current release version, in this case e.g. ``"0.9.5.1"``

    + IMPROVEMENT: Optimized imports and partly removed circular ones which are a bit tricky...


Note:
    CSSValue, CSSValueList, and CSSPrimitiveValue and the relevant methods/properties Property.cssValue and CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyCSSValue are more or less DEPRECATED and will probably be replaced with interfaces defined in CSSOM. For now use the properties and methods that handle values as simple strings, e.g. ``Property.value``. As the aforementioned classes are not hardly that useful anyway this should not be a big problem but please beware if you use or have used them.

    If you think this a bad idea please let me know!
