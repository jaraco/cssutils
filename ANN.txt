what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets. (Not a renderer  though!)

main changes
------------
0.9.5b1
    - **API CHANGE**: ``cssutils.css.CSSSStyleSheet.replaceUrls(replacer)`` has been **DEPRECATED** but is available as an utility function so simply use ``cssutils.replaceUrls(sheet, replacer)`` instead. For the why see ``getUrls(sheet)`` below.

    - **API CHANGE/FEATURE**: ``parseString`` has a new parameter ``encoding`` now which is used if a ``str`` is given for cssText. Otherwise it is ignored. (patch by doerwalter)

    - API CHANGE/FEATURE: ``.parse() .parseString()`` and constructor of ``CSSStyleSheet`` have a new parameter ``title`` needed for the cascade (yet to be implemented ;).

    + **FEATURE**: Referenced stylesheet in an @import rule is read and parsed now if possible. Therefor the ``href`` given during parsing (parameter ``href`` to the ``parse*`` functions is used. It is also properly set on imported rules. The ``name`` property of the @import rule is set as the imported sheets ``title`` property.

    + **FEATURE**: Added ``cssutils.getUrls(sheet)`` utility method to get all ``url(urlstring)`` values in ``CSSImportRules`` and ``CSSStyleDeclaration`` objects (properties). As this function and the above mentioned ``replaceUrls(sheet, replacer)`` are useful not only for a single sheet but (later) also for a stylesheet list they are not methods of CSSStyleSheet anymore (also because they are not part of the official DOM spec). (patch by doerwalter)

    + FEATURE: Added ``cssutils.parseURL(url, encoding=None, ...)``

    + BUGFIX: Fixes Issue #10, using full ``$LastChangedDate$`` in source files breaks code for some locales. Now only in a few files this svn:keywords replacement is used and only to a fixed length without the problematic part. In all other files ``$Id$`` is used which also includes simple but sufficient date information.

    + **BUGFIX/IMPROVEMENT**: Handling of trailing content, WS and comments in rules should be more consistent and properly handled now, added tests. Exception is ``CSSCharsetRule`` where no comments are allowed at all.

    - TESTS: **Tests need ``minimock`` now!** Install with ``easy_install minimock``



Note:
    CSSValue, CSSValueList, and CSSPrimitiveValue and the relevant methods/properties Property.cssValue and CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyCSSValue are more or less DEPRECATED and will probably be replaced with interfaces defined in CSSOM. For now use the properties and methods that handle values as simple strings, e.g. ``Property.value``. As the aforementioned classes are not hardly that useful anyway this should not be a big problem but please beware if you use or have used them.

    If you think this a bad idea please let me know!
