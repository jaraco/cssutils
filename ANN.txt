A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets. (Not a renderer though!)

about this release
------------------
0.9.7b3 is a beta release but quite stable.

main changes
------------
0.9.7b3 100620
    + API CHANGE: Changed parameters of script/utility function ``csscombine``.
            - parameter ``resolveVariables=True`` now (default was ``False`` before)
            - ``minify = True`` will not parse Comments at all. This is not really a change as comments were not kept in a minified stylesheet anyway but this may speed up stylesheet combination a bit

    + **PERFORMANCE/IMPROVEMENT**: Added parameter ``parseComments=True`` to CSSParser. If parsing with ``parser = cssutils.CSSParser(parseComments=False).parse...`` comments in a given stylesheet are simple omitted from the resulting stylesheet DOM.

    + **PERFORMANCE**: Compiled productions in cssutils tokenizer are cached now (to clear it use ``cssutils.tokenize2._TOKENIZER_CACHE.clear()``) which results in a slight performance improvement. Thanks to moscovich!
