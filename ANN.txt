what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets. (Not a renderer  though!)

main changes
------------
0.9.5rc1 080709
    - **API CHANGE/FEATURE**: ``The cssutils.log`` may be partly used like a standard logging log. The following methods are available: ('setLevel', 'getEffectiveLevel', 'addHandler', 'removeHandler') as well as all "messaging" calls like 'error', 'warning' etc.

      Therefor ``cssutils.log.setloglevel`` has been *DEPRECATED* and should be used via ``cssutils.log.setLevel``. The old method is still available though.

      ``cssutils.log.setlog`` has been renamed to ``cssutils.log.setLog`` but is still available but *DEPRECATED* too.

    - **FEATURE**: All three decoders in the codec now have an additional ``force`` argument. If ``force`` is false, the encoding from the input will only by used if is is detected explicitely via BOM or @charset rule.

    - **FEATURE**: ``cssparse`` script has new option ``-m --minify`` which results in the parsed CSS to be serialized minified

    - **FEATURE**: ``CSSCapture`` and ``csscombine`` are now available not only as standalone scripts but also via ``cssutils.script.CSSCapture`` and ``cssutils.script.csscombine`` repectively so you can use them programmatically now.

    - **BUGFIX**: A space after @rule keyword is added when serializing minified something like ``@media all{}``. Until now it was ``@mediaall{}`` which is recognized by Safari only and may not be valid at all.

    - **BUGFIX**: Properties of rules set via ``css.CSSStyleSheet.add`` or ``.insert`` were not set properly, e.g. ``parentStyleSheet`` or the stylesheet handling of new @import rules was buggy.

    - BUGFIX: Encountering OSError during resolving @import does not throw an error anymore but the resulting CSSImportRule.styleSheet will have a value of ``None``. OSError will probably only happen when using ``parseFile``.

    - **BUGFIX/IMPROVEMENT**: A style sheet with ``href == None`` (e.g. parsed with ``parseString()`` or build completely from scratch) uses ``os.getcwd()`` as its base href now to be able to resolve CSSImportRules.

    - **BUGFIX/IMPROVEMENT**: Rewrote ``csscombine`` script which should be much more stable now and handles namespaces correctly. Nested imports are still not resolved yet but this may come in the next release.

    - BUGFIX/IMPROVEMENT: Added catching of WindowsError to default fetcher (e.g. is a file URL references a file not present).

    - **BUGFIX/CHANGE**: Redone ``csscapture`` script. A few minor method changes (parameter ``ua`` of ``capture`` has been replaced by init parameter) and lots of internal improvement has been done.

    - CHANGE: ``CSSStyleSheet.add(rule)`` simply appends rules with no specific order in the sheet to the end of it. So e.g. COMMENTs, STYLE_RULEs, etc are appended while rules with a specific place are ordered-in as before (e.g. IMPORT_RULE or NAMESPACE_RULE). Until now rules of a specific type like COMMENTs were ordered together which does not really make sense. The ``csscombine`` script needs this functionality and the resulting combined sheets should be more readable and understandable now.

    - CHANGE: Default URL fetcher emits an ERROR instead of a warning if finding a different mine-type than ``text/css``.
    - a few other changes, bugfixes  and improvements

Note:
    CSSValue, CSSValueList, and CSSPrimitiveValue and the relevant methods/properties Property.cssValue and CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyCSSValue are more or less DEPRECATED and will probably be replaced with interfaces defined in CSSOM. For now use the properties and methods that handle values as simple strings, e.g. ``Property.value``. As the aforementioned classes are not hardly that useful anyway this should not be a big problem but please beware if you use or have used them.
