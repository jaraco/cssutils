about this release
------------------
0.9.6b4 is a bugfix release.

main changes
------------
+ BUGFIX: Issue #29 fixed. Double defined namespaces are replaced with a single (the last one) now.

- IMPROVEMENT: ``cssutils.resolveImports`` now keeps media information when to be resolved @import rule uses these. It wraps the imported rules in an @media rule which uses the same media information from the @media rule in the original sheet.

  An xml.dom.HierarchyRequestErr may occur if an imported sheet itself contains @imports with media information or other rules which are not allowed in a @media rule like @namespace rules. In that case cssutils cannot resolve the @import rule and logs a WARNING but keeps the original @import.
