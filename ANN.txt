what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets.

main changes since 0.9.4a3
--------------------------
for full details for 0.9.4a4 see the relevant README file http://cssutils.googlecode.com/svn/tags/TAG_0.9.4a4/README.txt and http://cssutils.googlecode.com/svn/tags/TAG_0.9.4a4/CHANGELOG.txt

- **FEATURE**: Implemented ``css.CSSFontFaceRule``.

- **FEATURE**: Added ``css.CSSStyleSheet.encoding`` which reflects the encoding of an explicit @charset rule. Setting the property to ``None`` removes an @charset rule if present and sets the encoding to the default value 'utf-8'. Setting a value of ``utf-8`` sets the encoding to the default value too but the @charset rule is explicitly added.

      Effectively this removes the need to use ``css.CSSCharsetRule`` directly as using this new property is easier and simpler.

      (A suggestion in the `CSSOM <http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#the-csscharsetrule>`_ but not yet resolved. IMHO it does make sense so it is present in cssutils. ``css.CSSCharsetRule`` remains though if you really *want* to use it).

- **BUGFIX/IMPROVEMENT**: ``css.SelectorList`` and ``stylesheets.MediaList`` have (Python) list like behaviour partly but are *directly not lists anymore* (which did not work properly anyway...).

- bugfixes and small improvements, added to docs
