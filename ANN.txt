what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets.
(Not a renderer though!)

about this release
------------------
0.9.8a2 is a bugfix release.

Compatibility to Python 3.x is currently in development. At the same time
Python 2.4 and Python 2.5 compatibility will probably be lost...

0.9.8 will be the last version to support Python 2.4 and Python 2.5.

main changes
------------
- BUGFIX: Fixed Issue #59 which showed a rather strange problem with longer space separated lists of font-family values being so slow to actually stop parsing.
- BUGFIX/IMPROVEMENT: Fixed Issue #48. ``CSSParser.parseUrl()`` uses the defined fetcher of this parser *for the initial stylesheet* at url too and not just the imported sheets *from* this sheet.
- BUGFIX: Fixed Issue #50 which prevented cssutils parsing the acid2.css file correctly. Problem were selectors starting directly with ``[class]`` (an attribute selector).

+ **API CHANGE (major)**
    (Known) named colors are parsed as ColorValue objects now. These are the 16 simple colors (black, white, etc) and `transparent` but not all Extended color keywords yet. Also changed ``ColorValue.type`` to ``Value.COLOR_VALUE``. ColorValue has additional properties ``red, green, blue, alpha`` and ``colorType`` which is one of IDENT, HASH or FUNCTION for now.
+ API CHANGE (minor)
    Removed already DEPRECATED ``cssutils.parse`` and ``CSSParser.parse``. Use the more specific functions/methods ``parseFile parseString parseUrl`` instead.

    Removed already DEPRECATED  ``cssutils.log.setlog`` and ``.setloglevel``. Use ``.setLog`` and ``.setLevel`` instead.

    Removed already DEPRECATED  ``cssutils.ser.keepUnkownAtRules`` (note the typo). Use ``.keepUnknownAtRules`` instead.

- IMPROVEMENT: Added validation profiles for some properties from `CSS Backgrounds and Borders Module Level 3 <http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/>`__, `CSS3 Basic User Interface Module <http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#resize>`__, `CSS Text Level 3 <http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/>`__
    mainly  `cursor`, `outline`, `resize`, `box-shadow`, `text-shadow`
