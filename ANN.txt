main changes since 0.9.4b1
--------------------------
for full details for 0.9.5a1 see the relevant CHANGELOG:  http://cssutils.googlecode.com/svn/tags/TAG_0.9.5a1/CHANGELOG.txt

A few (minor) non-backwards compatible changes have been made, please see http://cssutils.googlecode.com/svn/tags/TAG_0.9.5a1/documentation/migrate.txt for migration help.

0.9.5a1
    + **API CHANGE**: ``Property.name`` is now the same as ``Property.normalname`` which is DEPRECATED now. To access the literal name (the value which was available in ``name`` until now) use ``Property.literalname``. For most cases where a property name is used the new behaviour makes more sense, therefor the change.

        **Do not use ``normalname`` anymore, it will probably be removed for release 1.0.**

    + **API CHANGE**: iterating over ``css.CSSStyleDelcaration`` yields now *effective* properties only and not *all* properties set in the declaration. E.g. from ``color: red; c\olor: green`` only one Property is returned which has the value ``green``. To retrieve *all* properties use ``CSSStyleDeclaration.getProperties(all=True)``. Reason for this change is that for most cases the new default makes more sense.

    - **FEATURE**: ``css.CSSStyleDelcaration`` supports ``in`` now. Expected is a Property or a name of a property which is checked if already in the style declaration

    - **FEATURE**: ``css.Selector`` has a **readonly** property ``specificity`` now which is calculated as described at http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#specificity

    - **FEATURE**: Added ``css.CSSStyleDeclaration.getProperty(name, normalize=True)`` which returns the effective Property object for ``name``.

    - FEATURE: Implemented http://csswg.inkedblade.net/spec/css2.1#issue-23, URI may be ``URL(...)`` or ``u\r\6c(...)`` now

    + **BUGFIX**: Priority of Properties is acknowledged by all methods of ``css.CSSStylesDeclaration`` now.
