what is it
----------
A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets.

main changes
------------
0.9.5a4
    + **FEATURE**: Defining a namespace with a prefix but an empty namespaceURI is not allowed in XML 1.0 (but in XML 1.1). It is allowed in CSS and therefor also in cssutils.

    + **FEATURE**: Added property ``css.CSSImportRule.name`` and ``css.CSSMediaRule.name`` as decribed in http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-cascade/#cascading. It is parsed, serialized and available in this new property now. Property ``name`` is a constructor parameter now too.

    + **FEATURE**: ``css.UnknownRule`` is now parsed properly ...

    - **BUGFIX**: Improved escaping ...

    - **BUGFIX**: Fixed serialization of namespaces in Selector objects. Actually all possible namespaced selectors should be preserved now ...

    - **BUGFIX**: Default namespace is no longer used by attribute selectors.

    - IMPROVEMENT: Added simple testtool for functional tests in /examples plus lots of smaller bugfixes, improvements and refactorings


For full details for 0.9.5a4 see the relevant CHANGELOG:  http://cssutils.googlecode.com/svn/tags/TAG_0.9.5a4/CHANGELOG.txt

A few (minor) non-backwards compatible changes have been made, please see http://cssutils.googlecode.com/svn/tags/TAG_0.9.5a4/documentation/migrate.txt for migration help.


Note:
    CSSValue, CSSValueList, and CSSPrimitiveValue and the relevant methods/properties Property.cssValue and CSSStyleDeclaration.getPropertyCSSValue are more or less DEPRECATED and will probably be replaced with interfaces defined in CSSOM. For now use the properties and methods that handle values as simple strings, e.g. ``Property.value``. As the aforementioned classes are not hardly that useful anyway this should not be a big problem but please beware if you use or have used them.

    If you think this a bad idea please let me know!
