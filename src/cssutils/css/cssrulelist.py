    The CSSRuleList object represents an (ordered) list of statements.

    The items in the CSSRuleList are accessible via an integral index,
    starting from 0.

    Subclasses a standard Python list so theoretically all standard list
    methods are available. Setting methods like ``__init__``, ``append``,
    ``extend`` or ``__setslice__`` are added later on instances of this
    class if so desired.
    E.g. CSSStyleSheet adds ``append`` which is not available in a simple
    instance of this class!
