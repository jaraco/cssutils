=====================
implementation status
=====================
cssutils partly implements the DOM Level 2 Style Stylesheets and DOM Level 2 CSS interfaces. DOM Level 2 Core and DOM Level 2 Views are not implemented.

See the relevant specification on the W3C site for details about usage, cssutils tries to implement these as close as possible.
